# Contribution Guidelines

Want to contribute to *Synchly*? Here are some guidelines for how we accept help.

## Getting in Touch

Our [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/synchly/shared_invite/zt-iab7nopx-3hkGAgQh_VmXcFXkdEcCRg) channel is the best place to ask questions or get advice.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. [Fork](https://github.com/hariprasanths/synchly/fork) and clone the repository.
1. Comment on the issue that you are gonna take up, indicating the approximate time you would take to finish it.
1. After finishing, push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/hariprasanths/synchly/compare).
1. Wait for your `pull request` to be reviewed and merged.
1. In the meantime you can take up other issues as well.

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

 We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hariprasanths/synchly/issues) to track bugs, so please do a search before submitting to ensure your problem isn't already tracked.

### New Issues

Please provide the expected and observed behaviours in your issue.

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to implement a feature, or make a non-trivial change to the current implementation, we recommend [first filing an issue](https://github.com/hariprasanths/synchly/issues/new) marked with the `proposal` tag, so that the engineering team can provide guidance and feedback on the direction of an implementation.  This also help ensure that other people aren't also working on the same thing.

Bug fixes are welcome and should come with appropriate test coverage.
